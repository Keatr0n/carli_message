# carli_message

So I made this app in an afternoon because I didn't like responding to huge, multi-paragraph text messages.
So all I wanted was an easy way to respond to single paragraphs at a time without just dumping the message in notes and splitting it into small easy pieces.


Keep in mind when browsing this codebase, that this was meant to be used by me and me alone.
So it's kinda all over the place and poorly documented.


This also uses the latest version of flutter with null safety.
